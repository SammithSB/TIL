# TIL

New series of learning phase of writing code for small small algorithms and writing blogs about it.

## Structure

The repository is structured by days, with each day covering a different topic or set of algorithms.

### Day 1

Day 1 covers the Caesar Cipher, Luhn Algorithm, and Vigenère Cipher.

- **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
- **Luhn Algorithm**: A checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, commonly used in credit card numbers.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

For more details, check out my [blog post for Day 1](https://sammith.hashnode.dev/til-but-its-from-tweetsluhn-caesar-vigenere-cipher).

### Day 2

Day 2 is focused on the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It includes an implementation of BFS and an explanation of how it works.

- **Breadth First Search**: algorithm for searching a graph. It starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

### Day 3

Day 3 is focused on Caboose number that I came across while watching a Matt Parker video https://youtu.be/gM5uNcgn2NQ?si=J2DcmFXg-gpB8ctg
So we are essentially trying to figure out a number for which ```n^2 - n +41``` is a prime number for all n from 0 to n. Of course 0 will work as 41 is a prime number, so we can say 1 to n.
